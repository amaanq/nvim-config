# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

I finally decided to use the starter template instead of maintaining my own fork of LazyVim, which anyone else should do, but iirc I forked LazyVim before the template came out. Now, LazyVim can be updated without me running a bunch of PRs for merges and fixing conflicts by just overriding settings here :)
